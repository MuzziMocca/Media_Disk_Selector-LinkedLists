This project uses a generic class of a linked list created seperately.
The program I created prints out all the available media in store or lets the user 
filter or search the media disk according to price, nameduration etc. 
From thence forth it lets the user choose the media which they wish to taking home.

I created two methods in the generic class called myLinkedList: search() and reverse(), whereby search() 
uses a for loop and reverse using a while loop. My reason for creating search() method is to make it simple 
to locate what you are looking for instead of going through the entire list. As for my reverse() method, it was 
created also to make it easier to access the back of the list without having to go through the entire list. Reverse() is 
also a sorting method.
